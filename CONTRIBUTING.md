# agg-kicad Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to this library!

I am very grateful for new symbols and footprints, and of course fixes for any
errors or improvements to the build scripts.

If you are contributing a new symbol or footprint, there are a few things to
consider:

* Please provide a link to the documentation you worked from

I'm happy to accept most parts, but anything weirdly niche or specific or not
generally available might not get accepted. Feel free to check with me
beforehand.

To the extent that your contribution is copyrightable, you agree to licence it
under the same MIT licence as the rest of this library.
