# This is a KiCAD Library.

### Forked in a @adamgreig library.

This repository contains my collection of KiCAD symbols.

I encourage other people to use these parts; they're all licensed under a
permissive MIT licence and it's easy to simply copy one or two files from the
repository, or submodule the entire repo.

Contributions are also very welcome; please open a pull request and I will
carefully review the proposed additions. All contributions are likewise
licensed under the MIT licence. See `CONTRIBUITING`.

## Schematic Symbols

To use, add relevant `.lib` files to your project libraries. There is one 
`.lib` file per symbol.

## Licence

All content licensed under the MIT licence. See `LICENSE`.
