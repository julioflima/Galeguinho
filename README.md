# This is a KiCAD Library.

#### Forked in a @adamgreig.

This repository contains my collection of KiCAD symbols.

I encourage other people to use these parts; they're all licensed under a
permissive MIT licence and it's easy to simply copy one or two files from the
repository, or submodule the entire repo.

Contributions are also very welcome; please open a pull request and I will
carefully review the proposed additions. All contributions are likewise
licensed under the MIT licence. See `CONTRIBUITING`.

## Schematic Symbols

To use, add relevant `.lib` files to your project libraries. There is one 
`.lib` file per symbol.

## PCB Footprints

To use, add Galeguinho.pretty to your project libraries, with nickname Galeguinho recommended for compatibility with the schematic symbols.

The major ones have 3D files.

If you wanna adit some 3D files, the ones are in /CAD. Hint: use the FreeCAD.
